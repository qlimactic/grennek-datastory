    <div class="content-wrapper">I used my semester to further understand how games work in the age of the internet. Video games utilize a number of data-driven principles to attract players and generate interest.</div>

    <!-- Data Collection -->

      The first step in data collection was to play a number of games to get a decent sample size to better understand the ways in which I interacted with the game and the other players interacted with one another.</div>

  These games were informative in that they showed me a few habbits that I have and ones that I should probably focus on more, such as playing earlier in the day when I'm more alert. Additionally, it let me see the interaction between win rate and the propensity of having <em>toxic</em> players that create a rift among the team and its detriment.</div>

    Above is the data visualization I was able to make based on the data I collected. Around the spokes of the "clock" in the center you can see the times at which I won or lost. A clear trend is made that I had far more wins in the earlier parts of the day than the latter. Furthermore, the foreboding <em>toxic</em> demarcated-games tend to have a higher prevalence on the "Loss" side of the graphic. This indicates that there's a correlation between this toxicity amongst players and the outcome of the game. Lastly, the music I listened to didn't seem to have much of an affect on the overall outcome of the games, it was an interesting thought I had that perhaps more aggressive music might make me more irritable or prone to losing but I didn't find that to be the case in my small sample set.</p>

  The final product of what I've learned regarding psychographics and information as it pertains to video games is shown in this video. I used montages of games in the background as well as an overlay of relevant images as I discuss the various aspects of psychographics and gaming. I did this as it's a fair bit more interesting to have something to look at that isn't just a person lecturing at an audience. <br>
  <b>The biggest takeaway for me from this project was that demographics aren't always the best indicator in gauging interest in a product. I find this fascinating as it suggests that age, for instance, isn't necessarily a boundary as long as two people hold similar interests.</b>
